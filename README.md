# Virtual Obstacle-Avoiding Robot Simulator

Project Overview
The Virtual Obstacle-Avoiding Robot Simulator is a software-based simulation that models the movement of a virtual robot in a grid environment filled with obstacles. The robot is programmed to avoid obstacles using a simple algorithm, adjusting its path as needed to reach a target. This project helps users understand path-planning and basic AI behavior in robotics.

*Features
-Simulated grid environment with random obstacles
-Virtual robot with obstacle-detection logic
-Goal-oriented navigation with dynamic path adjustment
-User-customizable grid size, obstacle density, and robot speed

*Technologies Used
-Language: Python
-Libraries: pygame for visualization, random for generating obstacles, math for robot logic

*How It Works
-The virtual robot uses basic path-planning with obstacle detection to navigate a grid. It continuously scans its surroundings, adjusting direction to avoid obstacles. The grid updates in real-time, showing the robot's path to a target location while avoiding obstacles.
